We humans have this sick compulsion to keep track of time. Many time standards have emerged while trying to come up with standard ways to measure time in due course of existence of human civilization. Some independently and others successively.

There are so many time standards in use for various purposes. I have tried to simplify (ok I over simplified it) and present what you might just want to know.

Wikipedia defines time standard as

> Time standard is a specification for measuring time: either the rate at which time passes; or points in time; or both.  
> *-wiki*

Usually the time standard gives their own version of Second or Day or both. So in order to compare each time standard we just have to see what a Day or Second means according to that standard. What follows is the list of few often mentioned time standards and its exact details.

1. International Atomic Time (TAI):  
    It is very straight forward standard. It tics at the rate of SI Second. It defines day as exactly 86400 seconds. So it increaments a date exactly after span of 86400 seconds. Counting of day is as per Gregorian calendar.
    
2. Cordinated Universal Time (UTC):  
    This also tics at the rate of SI Seconds. But it is closely kept in sync with UT1 (explained next). It is at the most 0.9 seconds out of sync with UT1. UT1 *tics* at the rate of `mean solar day` which is slightly more than 86400 seconds (86400.002 seconds currently). So gradually UTC tends to drifts apart from UT1. So occasionaly a leap second is introduced in UTC (more explaination comming). UTC day is usually of 86400 seconds but occasionally it could be of 86401 seconds or 86399 seconds when leap second occurs. UTC also counts day as per Gregorian calendar.

3. Universal Time(UT1):  
    Successor of GMT and supercedes it. Only difference from GMT is that day changes at mid night, while in GMT day changes at noon.

4. Greenwich Mean Time (GMT):  
    Perhaps the first formal time standard. However it was originally not meant to be a time standard. Its purpose was to help maritime transport navigate by broadcasting accurate time at Greenwich Meridian.
