We humans have this sick compulsion to keep track of time. Many time standards have emerged while trying to come up with standard ways to measure time in due course of existence of human civilization. Some independently and others successively; to improve upon existing ones.

There are so many time standards in use for various purposes. I have tried to simplify (ok I over simplified it) and present what you might just want to know.

> Time standard is a specification for measuring time: either the rate at which time passes; or points in time; or both.

1. International Atomic Time (TAI):  
    It is very straight forward standard. It tics at the rate of SI Second. It defines day as exactly 86400 seconds. So it increaments a date exactly after span of 86400 seconds.
    
2. Cordinated Universal Time (UTC):  
    This also tics at the rate of SI Seconds. But it is closely kept in sync with UT1 (explained next). It is at the most 0.9 seconds out of sync with UT1. Since UT1 *tics* at the rate of `mean solar day` which is slightly more than 86400 seconds (86400.002 seconds currently). So gradually UTC tends to drifts apart from UT1. Which means 

3. Universal Time(UT1):  
    Successor of GMT and supercedes it.

4. Greenwich Mean Time (GMT):  
    Perhaps the first formal time standard.
