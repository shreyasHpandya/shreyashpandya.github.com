Want to know what is the difference between all the time standards that you hear about often. GMT, UTC, UT, TAI (and there are plenty more). Oh! and what is that leap second! then keep reading.

We humans have this sick compulsion to keep track of time. Many time standards have emerged while trying to come with standard ways to meassure time in due course of existance of human civilization. Some independently and others succesively to improve upon existing ones.

We are not going to look at the timeline of time standards, but understand few popular ones.

> Time standard is a specification for measuring time: either the rate at which time passes; or points in time; or both.
