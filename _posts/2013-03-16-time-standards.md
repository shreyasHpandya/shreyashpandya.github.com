Want to know what is the difference between all the time standards that you hear about often. GMT, UTC, UT, TAI (and there are plenty more). Oh! and what is that leap second! then keep reading.

We humans have this sick compulsion to keep track of time. Many time standards have emerged while trying to come with standard ways to measure time in due course of existence of human civilization. Some independently and others successively to improve upon existing ones.

We are not going to look at the timeline of time standards, but understand few popular ones.

Greenwich Mean Time (GMT):  
    Perhaps the first formal time standard.
    
International Atomic Time (TAI):
    It is very straight forward standard. It tics at the rate of SI Second. and increaments a date exactly at 86400 seconds.
    
Cordinated Universal Time:
    this also tics at the rate of SI Seconds. But it is closely kept in sync with UT1 (explained next). It is at the most 0.9 seconds out of sync with UT1. Since UT1 `tics` at the rate of mean solar day which is not exactly 86400 seconds but keeps changing based on earth's speed of rotation (which is slowing down). so to keep UTC in sync occasionally a leap second is introduced.
