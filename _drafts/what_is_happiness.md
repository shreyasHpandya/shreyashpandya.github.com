Perception of Happiness is highly subjective. In fact it could even be so contradictory
among two individuals that ones recreational activity may look entirely ridiculous
to other. However perception of happiness is now a days to very much extent affected by
popular multimedia- TV, Movies, MTV :) - people are constantly bombarded with the idea
of what is happiness and what is cool through this medium and even worst; this is the only medium
they collect this information through.

Now my complaint is not against these people. But rather a concern for that minority
population that does not find any gratification in these perceived superior gratifying
activities. They are frowned upon for having non mainstream interests. Getting laughed
at because you are seen reading a philosophy book.
