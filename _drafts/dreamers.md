They are very capable people. They often have creative ideas. They can obviously spot anomalies that others cant see even after explicitly pointing out. They can immediately suggest better design and spot what is redundant in the design. They sometimes laugh at pathetic organism tangled in the web of recreational activities. They often laugh at frightened soul trying so hard to save his position of power. They cant breath within closed walls of big corporate. Reality is too monotonous for their vivid imagination. day dreaming is their prime activity. Delusion is their real world. People see them as idiots. They can assign meaning to their life by way of act.
