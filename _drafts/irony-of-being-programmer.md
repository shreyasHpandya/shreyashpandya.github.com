Non programmers can never understand programmers.

There is a big problem that many programmers suffer from. Most coders are introverts. One thing about introverts is that they find interaction with other people exhausting. They have to spend time in solitude to restore themselves to normal level. If the organization they are working with has the culture of plenty of long meetings then they remain tangled in the cycle of exhaustion and restoration and never actually finding focused time to do some codding.
